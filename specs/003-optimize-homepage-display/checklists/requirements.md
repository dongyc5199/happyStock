# Specification Quality Checklist: 首页展示内容优化

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-30  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality checks completed successfully

**Key Findings**:
- Specification is complete and ready for planning phase
- All requirements are testable and technology-agnostic
- Success criteria are measurable with specific metrics
- User scenarios provide clear acceptance criteria
- Scope is well-defined with explicit out-of-scope items
- Reasonable assumptions documented for ambiguous areas

**Next Steps**: Ready to proceed with `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

## Notes

- All checklist items passed validation
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - reasonable defaults were used based on:
  - Platform mission statement (README.md)
  - Existing homepage implementation
  - Industry standards for investment platforms
- Spec is ready for implementation planning
