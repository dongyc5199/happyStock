### 3. Success Criteria Quality

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| ✅ All criteria are measurable | PASS | Specific metrics: 5s, 60fps, 90%, 20% reduction |
| ✅ Criteria are technology-agnostic | PASS | Focus on outcomes, not implementation |
| ✅ Each criterion has unique identifier | PASS | SC-001 to SC-010, sequential |
| ✅ Includes performance metrics | PASS | SC-002, SC-004, SC-005 |
| ✅ Includes user experience metrics | PASS | SC-001, SC-003, SC-006, SC-008 |
| ✅ Includes adoption/usage metrics | PASS | SC-007 (30% fold usage) |
| ✅ Includes compliance metrics | PASS | SC-009 (browser support), SC-010 (WCAG 2.1 AA) |

**Success Criteria Summary**:
- **Performance**: 60fps scrolling, <100ms touch response, load time ≤110% baseline
- **User Experience**: 5s recognition, 90% completion, 90% first-time understanding
- **Adoption**: 30% fold feature usage, 20% bounce rate reduction
- **Compliance**: Latest 2 browser versions, WCAG 2.1 AA

### 4. Key Entities Quality

| Criterion | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| ✅ Entities are clearly defined | PASS | 3 entities: Content Section, Navigation Dot, User Preferences |
| ✅ Entities avoid implementation details | PASS | No database schemas or API endpoints |
| ✅ Relationships between entities are described | PASS | Navigation dots map to sections, preferences control sections |

### 5. Completeness Check

| Section | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| ✅ User Stories & Testing | PASS | 4 stories, 19 scenarios, 9 edge cases |
| ✅ Functional Requirements | PASS | 23 requirements across 6 categories |
| ✅ Success Criteria | PASS | 10 measurable outcomes |
| ✅ Key Entities | PASS | 3 entities defined |
| ✅ Assumptions | PASS | 9 assumptions documented |
| ✅ Dependencies | PASS | 5 dependencies listed (APIs, libraries) |
| ✅ Out of Scope | PASS | 6 items explicitly excluded |

### 6. Technology Agnostic Check

| Item | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| ✅ No specific library names in requirements | ⚠️ WARNING | FR mentions "fullPage.js" in Dependencies section only ✅ |
| ✅ No database schemas in spec | PASS | Only logical entities, no tables |
| ✅ No API endpoints in spec | PASS | No backend changes required |
| ✅ No code snippets in spec | PASS | Pure requirements |
| ✅ No framework-specific terms | PASS | No React/Next.js specifics in FR section |

**Note**: Dependencies section appropriately mentions possible library choices (fullPage.js, Framer Motion) as examples, not requirements.

### 7. Testability Check

| User Story | Independently Testable? | MVP Value? | Notes |
|------------|------------------------|------------|-------|
| US1: Content categorization | ✅ YES | ✅ YES | Can ship just clean layout without scrolling |
| US2: Full-page scrolling | ✅ YES | ✅ YES | Core feature, can work without folding |
| US3: Collapsible sections | ✅ YES | ✅ YES | Enhancement, can work independently |
| US4: Custom layout order | ✅ YES | ⚠️ NICE-TO-HAVE | Advanced feature, optional for MVP |

**MVP Recommendation**: US1 + US2 = Minimum Viable Product (P1 stories)

## Issues Found

### Critical Issues
- ❌ **NONE**

### Major Issues
- ❌ **NONE**

### Minor Issues
- ⚠️ **FR-009**: "用户禁用整页滚动"功能未说明如何触发（按钮位置、默认状态）
  - **Suggestion**: 添加一个场景描述用户如何切换滚动模式
  - **Impact**: LOW (can be decided during planning)

### Recommendations
1. ✅ **Excellent prioritization**: P1 stories are clearly the most valuable
2. ✅ **Strong metrics**: Success criteria are specific and measurable
3. ✅ **Good edge case coverage**: Considered performance, conflicts, fallbacks
4. 💡 **Suggestion**: Consider adding a scenario for "用户在滚动动画进行中刷新页面" in edge cases
5. 💡 **Suggestion**: FR-010 mentions history API - consider if this should be a separate requirement for back button support

## Overall Assessment

| Category | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| User Stories | 9.5/10 | Excellent prioritization and testability |
| Requirements | 9/10 | Clear, testable, well-organized |
| Success Criteria | 10/10 | Measurable, comprehensive, realistic |
| Completeness | 10/10 | All sections present and detailed |
| Technology Agnostic | 9.5/10 | Implementation details only in Dependencies |
| **OVERALL** | **9.6/10** | ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING** |

## Clarification Questions

Based on the minor issue found:

| # | Question | Priority | Suggested Answer |
|---|----------|----------|------------------|
| Q1 | FR-009提到"用户禁用整页滚动"，这个开关应该放在哪里？默认状态是启用还是禁用？ | LOW | 建议：在页面右下角添加一个图标按钮（类似可访问性控件），默认启用整页滚动，用户可点击切换。状态保存在localStorage。 |

**Decision**: 这个问题影响较小，可以在Planning阶段决定，不阻塞当前spec。

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **APPROVED**: Specification is ready for planning phase
2. 🎯 **Recommendation**: Proceed with `/speckit.plan` to create detailed implementation plan
3. 📋 **Optional**: Address Q1 before planning, or defer to planning phase

## Sign-off

- **Spec Quality**: ✅ PASS (9.6/10)
- **Ready for Planning**: ✅ YES
- **Blocking Issues**: ❌ NONE
- **Reviewer**: GitHub Copilot
- **Date**: 2025-10-30
