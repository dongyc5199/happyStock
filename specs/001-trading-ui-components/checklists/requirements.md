# Specification Quality Checklist: TradingView 风格交易界面核心组件

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Check
✅ **PASS** - The specification is written from a user perspective without mentioning specific technologies. It focuses on WHAT users need (K线图表、交易功能) rather than HOW to implement them.

### Requirement Completeness Check
✅ **PASS** - All 20 functional requirements are clearly defined and testable. No clarification markers present. All requirements can be verified through the acceptance scenarios.

### Success Criteria Check
✅ **PASS** - All 10 success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic:
- Time-based metrics (30秒完成交易、1秒加载K线)
- Performance metrics (500毫秒盈亏更新、300毫秒搜索响应)
- User experience metrics (90%用户可独立完成操作)
- No implementation details mentioned

### Feature Readiness Check
✅ **PASS** - All 5 user stories are independently testable with clear priorities (P1, P2, P3) and acceptance scenarios. Each story can be developed and deployed independently.

## Notes

All checklist items have been validated and passed. The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` to proceed with implementation planning.

**Assumptions documented in the spec**:
1. K线数据的时间周期默认支持日K、周K、月K（行业标准）
2. 搜索防抖延迟设置为300毫秒（标准用户体验实践）
3. 交易历史分页每页20条记录（标准分页大小）
4. 盈亏颜色使用绿色（盈利）和红色（亏损），符合中国股市习惯
5. 键盘快捷键支持上下方向键和Enter键（标准交互模式）
