# Specification Quality Checklist: 优化首页标题栏导航

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### ✅ Content Quality - PASS

1. **No implementation details**: ✅ PASS
   - Spec focuses on "what" not "how"
   - Assumptions section mentions Lucide React and Zustand, but appropriately marked as assumptions, not requirements
   - No framework-specific code or API details in requirements

2. **User value focused**: ✅ PASS
   - All user stories explain value and priority rationale
   - Requirements framed from user perspective

3. **Non-technical language**: ✅ PASS
   - Clear business language throughout
   - Technical terms only in Assumptions section (appropriately isolated)

4. **Mandatory sections complete**: ✅ PASS
   - User Scenarios & Testing ✓
   - Requirements ✓
   - Success Criteria ✓

### ✅ Requirement Completeness - PASS

1. **No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers**: ✅ PASS
   - All requirements are specific and actionable
   - Made informed guesses for edge cases in Edge Cases section

2. **Testable and unambiguous**: ✅ PASS
   - Each FR has specific, verifiable criteria
   - Example: "FR-002: 图标必须在菜单文字的左侧显示，保持统一的间距和对齐"

3. **Success criteria measurable**: ✅ PASS
   - All SC include specific metrics (30%, 20%, 95%, 90 分, 4.5/5)
   - Example: "SC-001: 新用户找到特定导航功能的平均时间减少 30% 以上"

4. **Success criteria technology-agnostic**: ✅ PASS
   - No mention of React, APIs, or specific libraries
   - Focus on user-facing outcomes (time, conversion rate, satisfaction)

5. **Acceptance scenarios defined**: ✅ PASS
   - Each user story has 1-4 Given-When-Then scenarios
   - Cover happy paths and key variations

6. **Edge cases identified**: ✅ PASS
   - 5 edge cases identified (small screens, long usernames, slow network, default avatar, dark mode)

7. **Scope bounded**: ✅ PASS
   - "Out of Scope" section clearly defines what's NOT included
   - Prevents scope creep

8. **Dependencies and assumptions**: ✅ PASS
   - 5 assumptions documented (icon library, auth API, state management, default avatar, responsive breakpoint)

### ✅ Feature Readiness - PASS

1. **FRs have acceptance criteria**: ✅ PASS
   - User stories provide acceptance scenarios
   - FRs are specific enough to be testable

2. **User scenarios cover primary flows**: ✅ PASS
   - P1: Visual navigation (core UX)
   - P1: Login/registration (conversion)
   - P2: Logged-in user state (retention)

3. **Measurable outcomes defined**: ✅ PASS
   - 6 success criteria with quantitative metrics

4. **No implementation leakage**: ✅ PASS
   - Implementation details properly isolated in Assumptions

## Overall Status

✅ **SPECIFICATION READY FOR NEXT PHASE**

All quality criteria pass. The specification is complete, testable, and technology-agnostic. Ready to proceed with `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

## Notes

- Strong separation of concerns: requirements vs assumptions
- Good prioritization: P1 focuses on user conversion, P2 on retention
- Comprehensive edge case coverage for a UI feature
- Success criteria properly focus on user-facing metrics, not technical internals
